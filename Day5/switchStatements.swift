// we have to write 'forecast' multiple times.
// .rain is checked twice, and the second time can never be true.
// .snow was never checked at all, missing functionality

// - we start with switch forecast, which tells Swift the value we want to check.
// - case statements each have values that compare with forecast
// - each case lists one value type, and because we're switching on forecast lets
// the prefix not need to be allowed.
// - each case should have a colon to mark the start of the code for that case
// - We use a closing brace to end the switch statement

// REMEMBER that swift checks it cases in order and runs the first one that matches.

// IF you want Swift to carry on executing subsequent cases, use "falthrough"
